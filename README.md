# tap-tempo
Version 3 of the tap-tempo LFO for the AVR attiny series of microcontrollers, now free under the GPLv3 license.

Visit http://www.sabrotone.com for more info.

For those who have followed this project up until now; The previous tap-tempo LFO controller has been expanded with a few additional features, which required a larger package and more pins, hence the move from attiny85 to attiny84a. The plan is to refactor the attiny85 code and allow both options (albeit with a reduced feature set). If I get around to it I'll also move over the tap-tempo clock.
