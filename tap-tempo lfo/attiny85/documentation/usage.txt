Tap-tempo LFO v3 for the attiny85.
-----------------------------------

Pin overview:
=============
Pin 1 (PB5): (HVSP) External tempo clock input. Override and clock the base
             tempo from an external tap-tempo chip.
             (ISP) Unused (reset pin).
Pin 2 (PB3): Waveform ADC input (0 - +5V DC). The static voltage at this pin
             will determine the output waveform.
Pin 3 (PB4): Multiplier ADC input (0 - +5V DC). The static voltage at this pin
             will determine the actual tempo of the LFO signal relative to the
             current base tempo.
Pin 4 (GND): Ground.
Pin 5 (PB0): LFO output signal. The DDS PWM generated signal with the selected
             waveform, tempo and multiplier.
Pin 6 (PB1): Base tempo/sync clock output. Hook up a LED here to indicate base
             tempo, or use to clock external tap-tempo chip.
Pin 7 (PB2): Tap tempo input. Momentary switch used to set the tempo.
Pin 8 (VCC): +5V DC

Setup:
======
See example schematic for suggested setup.

- The chip requires a +5V DC power supply. A 100nF ceramic capacitor close to
  the VCC pin and connected to ground is recommended to reduce digital noise.
- Waveform selection and multiplier selection are input using ADC (Analog to
  Digital Conversion). Many configurations are possible based on the desired
  options, but the easiest way is to hook up a 10k potentiometer between +5V
  and ground with the wiper at the input selection pin (via a 1k resistor).
- Tap tempo is typically input via a momentary switch rugged enough to be
  operated with your foot. Connect this between the tap tempo input pin and
  ground.
- If you want the chip to be externally clocked from another tap-tempo chip,
  connect the external tempo clock input pin to an input jack tip via a 1k
  resistor. The input jack sleeve connects to ground.
  NOTE: If you're setting up both external clock and tap input switch it could
        be a good idea to use a DPDT selection switch to only route one of the
        pins to the chip at any one time, to prevent two sources from setting
        tempo at the same time.
  NOTE 2: This option disables the reset pin, making ISP as a programming
          method impossible. HVSP will be required.
- The LFO signal output connects to whatever circuitry you want to modulate
  with a Low Frequency Oscillation. Use a low-pass filter to get rid of the
  high frequency PWM noise and make the signal smoother.
- Connect a LED to the base tempo output pin for a visual indicator of the
  current base tempo, regardless of any multiplier setting. The cathode
  connects to the pin and a 1k resistor goes between the anode and VCC.
  Note that this signal, if routed to the external clock input of a secondary
  tap-tempo chip, can also clock the base tempo of the secondary chip.

Operation:
==========

When powered up, the defaults are:
----------------------------------
  - Base tempo is set to 1Hz (one clock cycle per second).

Setting tempo:
--------------
  1. Toggle the tap input switch once to initiate tempo counting. The base
     tempo LED (if connected) will light up and stay lit waiting for the second
     toggle.
  2. Toggle the tap input switch a second time to lock in the tempo. The base
     tempo LED (again, if connected) will turn off and resume normal operation
     (alternating between on/off between base tempo cycles).
  
  The base tempo will now equal the time interval between the two toggles.
  
  - When the tap input switch is toggled the first time, the LFO output signal
    is aligned accordingly. If the user then lets the tempo count time out,
    this can be a convenient way of aligning a given tempo in time without
    changing the interval. I.e. you've got the correct tempo, but the pulse is
    off-beat; by toggling once and letting it time out you can force the
    current tempo on-beat again.
  
  - If the second toggle does not arrive within a certain time frame, the tempo
    counting is cancelled and normal operation is resumed. A tempo output that
    is too quick will similarly be ignored.
  
  Minimum tap input time / max input tempo:
    20Hz = 50 milliseconds.
    
  Maximum tap input time / min input tempo:
    0.1Hz = 10 seconds.
  
Getting tempo from external chip (if included):
-----------------------------------------------
  - When an external tap-tempo clock signal is routed to the clock input pin,
    the base tempo will be kept in sync with this clock (given that it doesn't
    exceed the allowed tempo min/max etc).
  - Any tap input from the switch will cause temporary tempo abnormalities,
    until the next sync input clocks in the correct tempo again, so the tap
    input switch is best kept disconnected while operating on an external
    clock signal.
  - Both waveform selection and multiplier settings function normally.

Settings:
---------
  - The waveform and multiplier is set by holding the respective input
    selection pin at a given DC voltage. The possibilities are anything between
    0V and +5V, and each selection control subdivides the available voltage
    span in equal regions, one for each setting.
    
    E.g. if there were 5 available waveforms, a DC voltage between 0 and +1
    would equate to the first one, a DC voltage between +1 and +2 would equate
    to the second one, etc. 
  
  - Available waveforms:
    - Sine (default)
    - Ramp up.
    - Ramp down.
    - Triangle / saw tooth.
    - Square.
    - "Random" - a square wave, but with a "random" amplitude each cycle.
      
  - Available multipliers (based on 1:1 tempo being a quarter note):
    - "Whole note" - four times slower than base tempo.
    - "Dotted half note" - Three times slower than base tempo.
    - "Half note" - ...
    - "Dotted quarter note"
    - "Quarter note" (default) - 1:1 base tempo.
    - "Dotted eighth note"
    - "Eighth note"
    - "Dotted sixteenth note"
    - "Sixteenth note"
    
    Note: Having an equal number of multiplier options that are faster than-
          and slower than- means that if a potentiometer is used the center
          position should line up with the base tempo.
