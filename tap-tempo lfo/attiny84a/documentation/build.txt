Building
--------

What you need:
  - An ISP programmer that supports the attiny84a (and all that goes with it;
    USB cable etc).
  - An attiny84a AVR microcontroller.

I've only built this on OS X, but the process should be similar enough on Linux
and Windows. On Windows you also have the option of using AVR Studio. If you
do, some minor tweaking is probably necessary.

Note: Any existing firmware on the attiny84a will be erased when you upload a
      new one.

OS X
----
1. Install CrossPack to get avrdude and AVR libraries for GCC.

2. "cd" to the firmware directory where the source code is.
3. "make" to compile.
4. Connect the ISP programmer, attiny84a and power up.
5. "make flash" to upload the .hex binary to the attiny84a.
6. "make fuse" to set the attiny84a fuses correctly.
7. Power off the ISP programmer. Chip should be ready.
