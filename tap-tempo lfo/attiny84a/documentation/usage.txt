Pin overview:
=============
Pin 1 (VCC): +5V DC
Pin 2 (PB0): Speed adjust indicator. Pulled low when speed adjust setting is
             active.

Pin 13 (PA0): Tap tempo input. Momentary switch used to set the tempo.
Pin 14 (GND): Ground.

Setup:
======
See example schematic for suggested setup.

- The chip requires a +5V DC power supply. A 100nF ceramic capacitor close to
  the VCC pin and connected to ground is recommended to reduce digital noise.
- Waveform selection, multiplier selection and speed adjustments are all made
  using a single rotary encoder. Connect the rotary encoder legs to inputs A
  and B on the chip, and the center pin to ground. Each notch on the encoder
  toggles the previous or next setting on the currently active setting (more
  on this next).
- Selecting which setting is currently active is done via a momentary switch.
  Connect the switch between the settings selection input pin and ground. Many
  rotary encoders come with a momentary push button built in, and this can be
  very convenient to use here.
- It can be difficult to know what setting is currently active. Connect
  individual LEDS (cathodes) to each of the three indicator pins (PB0, PA2 and
  PA1), via a common 1k resistor between the anodes and VCC. The indicator pin
  matching the current setting will be pulled low, lighting the connected LED.
- Tap tempo is typically input via a momentary switch rugged enough to be
  operated with your foot. Connect this between the tap tempo input pin and
  ground.
- If you want the chip to be externally clocked from another tap-tempo chip,
  connect the external tempo clock input pin to an input jack tip via a 1k
  resistor. The input jack sleeve connects to ground.
  NOTE: If you're setting up both external clock and tap input switch it could
        be a good idea to use a DPDT selection switch to only route one of the
        pins to the chip at any one time, to prevent two sources from setting
        tempo at the same time.
- The LFO signal output connects to whatever circuitry you want to modulate
  with a Low Frequency Oscillation. Use a low-pass filter to get rid of the
  high frequency PWM noise and make the signal smoother.
- Connect a LED to the base tempo output pin for a visual indicator of the
  current base tempo, regardless of any multiplier setting. The cathode
  connects to the pin and a 1k resistor goes between the anode and VCC.
  Note that this signal, if routed to the external clock input of a secondary
  tap-tempo chip, can also clock the base tempo of the secondary chip.
- Connect a LED to the actual tempo output pin for a visual indicator of the
  current tempo, including whatever multiplier setting is currently active.

Operation:
==========

When powered up, the defaults are:
----------------------------------
  - Base tempo is set to 1Hz (one clock cycle per second).
  - The waveform is set to sine.
  - The multiplier is set to 1:1 (a quarter note).
  - The speed adjustment is set to +/- 0 milliseconds.
  - The current setting is set to speed adjustments.

Setting tempo:
--------------
  1. Toggle the tap input switch once to initiate tempo counting. The base
     tempo LED (if connected) will light up and stay lit waiting for the second
     toggle.
  2. Toggle the tap input switch a second time to lock in the tempo. The base
     tempo LED (again, if connected) will turn off and resume normal operation
     (alternating between on/off between base tempo cycles).
  
  The base tempo will now equal the time interval between the two toggles.
  
  - When the tap input switch is toggled the first time, the LFO output signal
    is aligned accordingly. If the user then lets the tempo count time out,
    this can be a convenient way of aligning a given tempo in time without
    changing the interval. I.e. you've got the correct tempo, but the pulse is
    off-beat; by toggling once and letting it time out you can force the
    current tempo on-beat again.
  
  - If the second toggle does not arrive within a certain time frame, the tempo
    counting is cancelled and normal operation is resumed. A tempo output that
    is too quick will similarly be ignored.
  
  Minimum tap input time / max input tempo:
    20Hz = 50 milliseconds.
    
  Maximum tap input time / min input tempo:
    0.1Hz = 10 seconds.
  
  - The current tempo can also be micro-adjusted via the rotary encoder when 
    the current setting is set to speed adjustment. The adjustments will be
    immediately applied to the base tempo and the LFO output.
  - Whenever a new tempo is assigned, any speed adjustments are reset.
  
Getting tempo from external chip:
---------------------------------
  - When an external tap-tempo clock signal is routed to the clock input pin,
    the base tempo will be kept in sync with this clock (given that it doesn't
    exceed the allowed tempo min/max etc).
  - Any tap input from the switch will cause temporary tempo abnormalities,
    until the next sync input clocks in the correct tempo again, so the tap
    input switch is best kept disconnected while operating on an external
    clock signal.
  - Similar to tap inputs, any speed adjustments will also quickly be reset by
    the next sync input.
  - Both waveform selection and multiplier settings function normally.

Settings:
---------
  - The rotary encoder is always assigned one of the settings. Toggling the
    settings selection input pin reassigns the encoder to the next setting:
      
      "speed adjust" -> "waveform" -> "multiplier" -> "speed adjust" etc.
  
  - When assigned to speed adjust:
    - Rotating the encoder adds or subtracts a number of milliseconds to the
      base tempo. When continuously turned the speed adjustment of each
      notch/step gradually increases.
    - The speed cannot be adjusted beyond either of the min/max tempo bounds
      (see above).
      
  - When assigned to waveform:
    - Rotating the encoder selects the next or previous waveform in a circular
      fashion.
    - Available waveforms:
      - Sine (default)
      - Ramp up.
      - Ramp down.
      - Triangle / saw tooth.
      - Square.
      - "Random" - a square wave, but with a "random" amplitude each cycle.
      
  - When assigned to multiplier:
    - Rotating the encoder left or right selects the next slower or faster
      multiplier, stoping  at the lowest or highest one (no wrapping around).
    - Available multipliers (based on 1:1 tempo being a quarter note):
      - "Whole note" - four times slower than base tempo.
      - "Dotted half note" - Three times slower than base tempo.
      - "Half note" - ...
      - "Dotted quarter note"
      - "Quarter note" (default) - 1:1 base tempo.
      - "Dotted eighth note"
      - "Eighth note"
      - "Dotted sixteenth note"
      - "Triplet note" - Three cycles for each base tempo cycle.
      - "Sixteenth note"
  
  - The currently selected setting can be reset to it's default value by
    connecting and keeping the settings selection switch connected for 2
    seconds or more. This will perform a reset of the current setting rather
    than cycling to the next setting.
  - Default settings are:
    - "Speed adjust": +/- 0 milliseconds; i.e. cancel any adjustments that has
      been made and restore the last tap input tempo.
    - "Waveform": Sine wave.
    - "Multiplier": "Quarter note"; i.e. no multiplier.
